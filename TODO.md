# TODO

- [ ] archive `zpy`, rename `zthread` to `ztpy` for 'zeromq-threaded-python', enable additional build variants.

- [ ]  `krait` and `cobra` to swap names

- [ ] Alternatively, use [buildpy](https://github.com/shakfu/buildpy) and
  [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) to build relocatable
  python builds, generate xccongfig and xcode projects

- [ ] Try pyodide in the browser to communicate with Max via the external / 
  mongoose websockets.
