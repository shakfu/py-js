# TODO

- [ ] Archive `zpy`, which is not so useful now, given `ztp`

- [ ] Alternatively, use [buildpy](https://github.com/shakfu/buildpy) and [xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) to build relocatable
  python builds, generate xccongfig and xcode projects

- [ ] Try pyodide in the browser to communicate with Max via the external / 
  mongoose websockets.

- [x] Swap names of `cobra` and `krait` externals.

- [x] rename `zthread` to `ztp` for 'zeromq-threaded-python', enable additional build variants.
