# mpyx: example use of cobra with maxcpp

This is a proof-of-concept of using a variant of `cobra`, the single-header c++ python3 library for Max externals in a c++ class using [min-api](https://github.com/cycling74/min-api).

## Usage

This can be built individually with:

```sh
make mpyx
```

or as part of the `demos` subgroup:

```sh
make demos
```
