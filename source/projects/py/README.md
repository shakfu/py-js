# py: a general purpose python3 max external

A general purpose Max external which embeds a python3 interpreter and is made up of three integrated parts which make it quite straightforward to extend:

1. The `py` Max external which is written in c using both the Max c-api and the Python3 c-api.

2. A pure python module, `py_prelude.py` which is converted to `py_prelude.h` and compiled with `py` and then pre-loaded into the `globals()` namespace of every `py` instance.

3. A builtin `api` module which is derived from a cython-wrapper of a subset of the Max c-api.

The following provides a brief view of key attributes and methods:

## Overview

This overview will cover the following two external implementations:

The `py` external provides a more featureful two-way interface between max and python in a way that feels natural to both languages.

The external has access to builtin python modules and the whole universe of 3rd party modules, and further has the option of importing a builtin `api` module which uses [cython](https://cython.org) to wrap selective portions of the max c-api. This allows regular python code to directly access the max-c-api and script Max objects.

There are 3 general deployment variations:

1. **Linked to system python**. Linking the externals to your system python (homebrew, built from source, etc.) This has the benefit of re-using your existing python modules and is the default option.

2. **Embedded in package**. Embedding the python interpreter in a Max package: in this variation, a dedicated python distribution (zipped or otherwise) is placed in the `support` folder of the `py/js` package (or any other package) and is linked to the `py` external. This makes it size efficient and usable in standalones.

3. **Embedded in external**. The external itself as a container for the python interpreter: a custom python distribution (zipped or otherwise) is stored inside the external bundle itself, which can make it portable and usable in standalones.

As of this writing all three deployment scenarios are availabe, however it is worth looking more closely into the tradeoffs in each case, and a number of build variations exist.

Deployment Scenario    | `py`
:--------------------- | :--:
Linked to sys python   | yes
Embeddded in package   | yes
Embeddded in external  | yes

### Key Features

The `py` external has the following c-level methods:

category | method   | param(s)      | in/out | can change ns
:------- | :--------| :------------ | :----: | :------------:
core     | import   | module        | in     | yes
core     | eval     | expression    | out    | no
core     | exec     | statement     | in     | yes
core     | execfile | file          | in     | yes
extra    | assign   | var, data     | in     | yes
extra    | call     | var(s), data  | out    | no
extra    | code     | expr or stmt  | out?   | yes
extra    | anything | expr or stmt  | out?   | yes
extra    | pipe     | var, funcs    | out    | no
extra    | fold     | f, n, args    | out    | no
time     | sched    | ms, fun, args | out    | no
editor   | read     | file          | n/a    | no
editor   | load     | file          | n/a    | no
interobj | scan     |               | n/a    | no
interobj | send     | name, msg, .. | n/a    | no
meta     | count    |               | n/a    | no

Note that he `code` method allows for import/exec/eval of python code, which can be said to make those 'fit-for-purpose' methods redundant. However, it has been retained because it provides additional strictness and provides a helpful prefix in messages which indicates message intent.

#### Core

py/js's *core* features have a one-to-one correspondance to python's *very high layer* as specified [here](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/veryhigh.html). In the following, when we refer to an *object*, we refer to instances of the `py` external.

- **Per-object namespaces**. Each object has a unique name (which is provided automatically or can be set by the user), and responds to an `import <module>` message which loads the specified python module in its namespace (essentially a `globals` dictionary). Notably, namespaces can be different for each instance.

- **Eval Messages**. Responds to an `eval <expression>` message in the left inlet which is evaluated in the context of the namespace. `py` objects output results to the left outlet, send a bang from the right outlet upon success or a bang from the middle outlet upon failure.

- **Exec Messages**. Responds to an `exec <statement>` message and an `execfile <filepath>` message which executes the statement or the file's code in the object's namespace. For `py` objects, this produces no output from the left outlet, sends a bang from the right outlet upon success or a bang from the middle outlet upon failure.

#### Extra

The *extra* category of methods  makes the `py` object play nice with the max/msp ecosystem:

- **Assign Messages**. Responds to an `assign <varname> [x1, x2, ..., xN]` which is equivalent to `<varname> = [x1, x2, ..., xN]` in the python namespace. This is a way of creating variables in the object's python namespace using max message syntax. This produces no output from the left outlet, a bang from the right outlet upon success, or a bang from the middle outlet upon failure.

- **Call Messages**. Responds to a `call <func> arg1 arg2 ... argN` kind of message where `func` is a python callable in the py object's namespace. This corresponds to the python `callable(*args)` syntax. This makes it easier to call python functions in a max-friendly way. If the callable does not have variable arguments, it will alternatively try to apply the arguments as a list i.e. `call func(args)`. Future work will try make `call` correspond to a python generic function call: `<callable> [arg1 arg2 ... arg_n] [key1=val1 key2=val2 ... keyN=valN]`. This outputs results to the left outlet, a bang from the right outlet upon success, or a bang from the middle outlet upon failure.

- **Pipe message**. Like a `call` in reverse, responds to a `pipe <arg> <f1> <f2> ... <fN>` message. In this sense, a value is *piped* through a chain of python functions in the objects namespace and returns the output to the left outlet, a bang from the right outlet upon success, or a bang from the middle outlet upon failure.

- **Code or Anything Messages**. Responds to a `code <expression || statement>` or (anything) `<expression || statement>` message. Arbitrary python code (expression or statement) can be used here, because the whole message body is converted to a string, the complexity of the code is only limited by Max's parsing and excaping rules. (EXPERIMENTAL and evolving).

#### Interobject Communication

- **Scan Message**. Responds to a `scan` message with arguments. This scans the parent patcher of the object and stores scripting names in the global registry.

- **Send Message**. Responds to a `send <object-name> <msg> <msg-body>` message. Used to send *typed* messages to any named object. Evokes a `scan` for the patcher's objects if a `registry` of names is empty.

#### Editing Support

- **Line REPL**. The `py`has two bpatcher line `repls`, one of which embeds a `py` object and another which has an outlet to connect to one. The repls include a convenient menu with all of the `py` object's methods and also feature coll-based history via arrow-up/arrow-down recall of entries in a session. Of course, a coll can made to save all commands if required.

- **Experimental Remote Console**. A new method (due to [Iain Duncan](https://github.com/iainctduncan)) of sending code to the `py` node via `udp` has been implemented and allows for send-from-editor and send-from-interactive-console capabilities. The clients are still in their infancy, but this method looks promising since you get syntax highlighting, syntax checking, and other features. It assumes you want to treat your `py` nodes as remotely accessible `server/interpreters-in-max`.

- **Code Editor**. Double-clicking the `py` object opens a code-editor. This is populated by a `read` message which reads a file into the editor and saves the filepath to an attribute. A `load` message also `reads` the file followed by `execfile`. Saving the text in the editor uses the attribute filepath and execs the saved text to the object's namespace.

#### Scripting

- **Exposing Max API to Python** A portion of the max api in `c74support/max-includes` has been converted to a cython `.pxd` file called `api_max.pxd`. This makes it available for a cython implementation file, `api.pyx` which is converted to c-code during builds and embedded in the external. This code enables a custom python builtin module called `api` which can be imported by python scripts in `py` objects or via `import` messages to the object. This allows the subset of the max-api which has been wrapped in cython code to be called directly by python scripts or via messages in a patcher.

## Caveats

- Packaging and deployment of python3 externals has improved considerably but is still a work-in-progress: basically needing further documentation, consolidation and cleanup. For example, there are currently two build systems which overlap: a python3 based build system to handle complex packaging cases and cmake for handling the quick and efficient development builds and general cases.

- As of this writing, the `api` module, does not (like apparently all 3rd party python c-extensions) unload properly between patches and requires a restart of Max to work after you close the first patch which uses it. Unfortunately, this is a known [bug](https://bugs.python.org/issue34309) in python which is being worked on and may be [fixed](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/cython-users/SnVpCE7Sq8M/hdT8S2iFBgAJ) in future versions (python 3.12 perhaps?).

- `Numpy`, the popular python numerical analysis package, falls in the above category. In newer versions of Python the situation is improving as above, but in python 3.9.x, it thankfully doesn't crash but gives the following error:

```bash
[py __main__] import numpy: SystemError('Objects/structseq.c:401: bad argument to internal function')
```

This just means that the user opened a patch with a `py-js` external that imports `numpy`, then closed the patch and (in the same Max session) re-opened it, or created a new patch importing `numpy` again.

To fix it, just restart Max and use it normally in your patch. Treat each patch as a session and restart Max after each session.

- `core` features relying on pure python code are supposed to be the most stable, and *should* not crash under most circumstances, `extra` features are less stable since they are more experimental, etc..

- The `api` module is the most experimental and evolving part of this project, and is completely optional. If you don't want to use it, don't import it.
