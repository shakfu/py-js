# builder

The python `builder` package organizes the compilation and packaging of externals built against custom python builds.

The initial flow is as follows:

```sh
builder.__main__.Application
    -> builder.factory.FactoryManager
    -> builder.core.Builder subclass
```

The `builder.core.Builder` variants are responsible for producing a single compiled product which are specified instances of `builder.core.Product`.

The `builder.core.Builder` instance uses instances of supporting classes such as `builder.depend.DependencyManager` and `builder.shell.ShellCmd` to execute this process.

Once the concrete compiled product is produced, it can be packaged, signed, notarized with the `builder.package.PackageManager`.

## builder.package - Package Manager

Does the equivalent of the following workflow

1. Create Keychain Profile

```sh
xcrun notarytool \
    store-credentials "NOTARYTOOL_PROFILE" \
    --apple-id "firstname.lastname@example.com" \
    --team-id ABCDEF123X \
    --password "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"

# where `-â€”password` is an app-specific password

VARIANT="shared-ext"

export DEV_ID="<first_name> <last_name>"

make ${VARIANT}

make sign

make dmg PKG_NAME="${VARIANT}"

export PRODUCT_DMG="<absolute-path-to-dmg>"

make sign-dmg ${PRODUCT_DMG}

xcrun notarytool submit ${PRODUCT_DMG} --keychain-profile "<keychain_profile>"

xcrun stapler staple ${PRODUCT_DMG}

mv ${PRODUCT_DMG} ~/Downloads/pyjs-builds
```

## CodesignExternal

Is a utility class which recursively walks through a bundle or folder structure
and signs all of the internal binaries which fit the given pattern

Note: you can reduce the logging verbosity by making DEBUG=False

Steps to sign a Max package with a externals in the 'externals' folder
depending on a framework or two in the 'support' folder:

1. codesign externals `[<name>.mxo, ...]` in `externals` folder

    `builder.sign_folder('externals')`

2. codesign frameworks or libraries `[<name>.framework | python<ver> | ...]`

    `builder.sign_folder('support')`

3. create package as folder then convert to `.dmg`

    - create $package folder
    - copy or use ditto to put everything into $package
    - convert folder into .dmg

    `builder.package_as_dmg()`

    - defaults to project name

4. notarize $package.dmg

    `builder.notarize_dmg()`

5. staple $package.dmg

    `builder.staple_dmg()`
