# libcmx: common max library

This project is created as a common library of general functions which may be useful in Max externals and which can be used across projects.

It's implemented as a single header library and has only a dependency on `max-sdk-base`.

There are no projects currently using it except the `demo` scratchpad, but it may be use in a future refactoring effort.
