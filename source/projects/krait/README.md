# The Krait Experiment

Provides a single-header cpp-centric `py_interpreter.h` library with a python3 interpreter class.

Note that `krait.cpp` is just a demonstration of an external using `py_interpreter.h`.

I called it `krait`, in honour of the 'Krait Lightspeeder' in the original [Elite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)).


## Building

From the root of the `py-js` project

```bash
make projects
```

This will build all subprojects, including `krait`, using the standard cmake build process.

## Tests

See `krait.maxhelp` in `py-js/help`
