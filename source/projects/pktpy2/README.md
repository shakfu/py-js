# pktpy2: a pocketpy v2.0.x max external

This external embeds version `2.0.8` of [pocketpy](https://github.com/blueloveTH/pocketpy), a Python interpreter for game engines, in a Max external. It is called `pktpy2` to differentiate it from the `pktpy` external which is based on the version `1.4.6` of `pocketpy`.

The major difference / benefit between v2 and v1 is that the lua-like c-api used in the v2 implementation makes the external a good deal smaller (572KB for v2 vs 1.3MB for v1 so far).
