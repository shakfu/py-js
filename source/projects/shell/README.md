# shell

The shell max external is written and Copyright (c) 2013-2019 Jeremy Bernstein and Bill Orcutt

The original github repo is <https://github.com/jeremybernstein/shell>

It is included here for convenience and because it has an elegant implementation using threading and interprocess communication.

The intent is to learn from this and perhaps incorporate some of the techniques in the python externals.

## Changes from original

- change `sprintf` to `snprintf_zero`
