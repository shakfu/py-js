## Preparing a standalone for Apple App Store

## Python Distribution

for python 3.8

```bash
NAME=mxpython
PWD=$(pwd)
PREFIX=$PWD/$NAME

./configure MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.13 \
  --prefix=$PREFIX \
  --enable-shared \
  --with-universal-archs=64-bit \
  --with-lto \
  --enable-optimizations

```

## `sys.prefix`

A string giving the site-specific directory prefix where the platform independent Python files are installed; by default, this is the string '/usr/local'. This can be set at build time with the --prefix argument to the configure script. The main collection of Python library modules is installed in the directory prefix/lib/pythonX.Y while the platform independent header files (all except pyconfig.h) are stored in prefix/include/pythonX.Y, where X.Y is the version number of Python, for example 3.2.

Note If a virtual environment is in effect, this value will be changed in site.py to point to the virtual environment. The value for the Python installation will still be available, via base_prefix.

## `sys.exec_prefix`

A string giving the site-specific directory prefix where the platform-dependent Python files are installed; by default, this is also '/usr/local'. This can be set at build time with the --exec-prefix argument to the configure script. Specifically, all configuration files (e.g. the pyconfig.h header file) are installed in the directory exec_prefix/lib/pythonX.Y/config, and shared library modules are installed in exec_prefix/lib/pythonX.Y/lib-dynload, where X.Y is the version number of Python, for example 3.2.

Note If a virtual environment is in effect, this value will be changed in site.py to point to the virtual environment. The value for the Python installation will still be available, via base_exec_prefix.
