# builder: pyjs python external builder


## Current Status of Builders

As mentioned earlier, as of this writing this project uses a combination of a `Makefile` in the project root, a basic `cmake` build option and a custom python build system, `builder`, which resides in the `py-js/source/py/builder` package. The `Makefile` is a kind of 'frontend' to the more complex python build system. The latter can be used directly of course. A view into its many options can be obtained by typing the following:

```bash
cd py-js/source/py
python3 -m builder --help
```

`builder` was developed to handle the more complex case of downloading the source code of python (from python.org) and its dependencies from their respective sites and then building custom python binaries with which to reliably compile python3 externals which are portable, relocatable, self-contained, small-in-size, and usable in Max Packages and Standalones.

## Build Variations

One of the objectives of this project is to cater to a number of build variations. As of this writing, the following table gives an overview of the different builds and their differences:

There is generally tradeoff of size vs. portability:

build command       | format       | size_mb  | deploy_as | pip      | portable | numpy    | isolated |
:-------------------| :----------- | :------: | :-------: | :-------:| :-------:| :-------:| :-------:|
make                | framework    | 0.3      | external  | yes [1]  | no       | yes      | yes      |
make brew-ext       | hybrid  [3]  | 13.6     | external  | no       | yes      | yes      | no       |
make brew-pkg       | hybrid  [3]  | 13.9     | package   | yes      | yes      | yes      | yes      |
make static-ext     | static       | 9.0      | external  | no       | yes      | no [2]   | yes      |
make shared-ext     | shared       | 15.7     | external  | no       | yes      | yes      | no       |
make shared-pkg     | shared       | 18.7     | package   | yes      | no [4]   | yes      | yes      |
make framework-ext  | framework    | 16.8     | external  | no       | yes      | yes      | no       |
make framework-pkg  | framework    | 16.8     | package   | yes      | yes      | yes      | yes      |

[1] has automatic access to your system python's site-packages

[2] current static external implementation does not work with numpy due to symbol access issues.

[3] *hybrid* means that the source system was a `framework` and the destination system is `shared`.

[4] the shared-pkg variant does build a compliant 'Framework-type' bundle and hence cannot be notarized.

- *pip*: the build allows or provides for pip installation

- *portable*: the externals can be deployed as portable packages or standalones

- *numpy*: numpy compatibility

- *isolated*: if yes, then different external types can run concurrently without issue

### Python Version Compatibility



[1] Homebrew only tested on current relase (3.9.10), other versions are expected to work without issues.

[2] Relocatable python can select its own version of python (Only tested with python 3.9.10, other versions should work without issues)

### Packages vs Self-contained Externals

The Max package format is a great way to move a bunch of related patches and externals around. This format also makes a lot of sense for `py-js`, giving a number of advantages over other alternatives:

1. Portable: Relocatable, you can move it around and it still works.

2. Extendable: Can include a full fit-for-purpse python3 installation in the `support` directory with its own site-packages. Packages can be `pip` installed and all of the `site-packages` is automatically made available to the thin 'client' python3 externals in the package's `externals` folder.

3. Size-efficient, since you don't need to duplicate functionality in each external

4. Standalone installable: Recent changes in Max have allowed for this to work in standalones. Just create your standalone application from a patcher which which includes the `py` and `pyjs` objects. Once it is built into a `<STANDALONE>` then copy the whole aforementioned `py` package to `<STANDALONE>/Contents/Resources/C74/packages` and delete the redundant `py.mxo` in `<STANDALONE>/Contents/Resources/C74/externals` since it already exists in the just-copied package.

5. Better for codesigning / notarizing scenarios since Packages are not sealed bundles like externals.

On the other hand, sometimes you just want an external which embeds a python distribution and custom extensions and code:

1. Portable: Relocatable, you can move it around and it still works.

2. Extendable: Can include new pure python code and be provided with new additionas to `sys.path`

3. Size-efficient and fit-for-purpose

4. Standalone installable. Easiest to install in standalones

5. Can be codesigned and notarized relatively easily. [1]

[1] If you want to codesign and notarize it for use in your standalone or package, the [codesigning / notarization script](source/py/scripts/notarize.sh) and related [entitlements file](source/py/scripts/entitlements.plist) can be found in the [source/py/scripts](source/py/scripts) folder.

## The relocatable-python variation

[relocatable-python](https://github.com/gregneagle/relocatable-python) is Greg Neagle's excellent tool for building standalone relocatable Python.framework bundles.

It works so well, that its been included in the `builder` application as an external (embedded dependency).

It can be seen in the `relocatable-pkg` make option which will download a nice default `Python.framework` to the `support` directory used for compiled both `py` and `pyjs` externals:

```bash
make relocatable-pkg
```

More options are available if you use the `builder` package directly:

```bash
$ python3 -m builder pyjs relocatable_pkg --help
usage: __main__.py pyjs relocatable_pkg [-h] [--destination DESTINATION]
                                        [--baseurl BASEURL]
                                        [--os-version OS_VERSION]
                                        [--python-version PYTHON_VERSION]

                                        [--pip-modules PIP_MODULES]
                                        [--no-unsign] [--upgrade-pip]
                                        [--without-pip] [--release] [-b] [-i]
                                        [--dump]

optional arguments:

  --pip-requirements PIP_REQUIREMENTS
                        Path to a pip freeze requirements.txt file that
                        describes extra Python modules to be installed. If not
                        provided, no modules will be installed.

## Sidenote about building on a Mac

If you are developing the package in `$HOME/Documents/Max 8/Packages/py` and you have your iCloud drive on for Documents, you will find that `make` or `xcodebuild` will reliably fail with 1 error during development, a codesigning error that is due to icloud sync creating detritus in the dev folder. This can be mostly ignored (unless your only focus is codesigning the external).

The solution is to move the external project folder to folder that's not synced-with-icloud  (such as `$HOME/Downloads` for example) and then run `xattr -cr .` in the project directory to remove the detritus (which ironically Apple's system is itself creating) and then it should succeed (provided you have your `Info.plist` and `bundle id` correctly specified). Then just symlink the folder to `$HOME/Documents/Max 8/Packages/` to prevent this from recurring.

I've tried this several times and and it works (for "sign to run locally" case and for the "Development" case).


## Packaging

This project has a builtin features to package, sign, notarize and deploy python3 externals for Max/MSP.

These features are implemented in `py-js/source/project/py/builder/packaging.py` and are exposed via two interfaces:

### The `argparse`-based interface of `builder`:

```bash
$ python3 -m builder package --help
usage: builder package [-h] [-v VARIANT] [-d] [-k KEYCHAIN_PROFILE]
                           [-i DEV_ID]
                           ...

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v VARIANT, --variant VARIANT
                        build variant name
  -d, --dry-run         run without actual changes.
  -k KEYCHAIN_PROFILE, --keychain-profile KEYCHAIN_PROFILE
                        Keychain Profile
  -i DEV_ID, --dev-id DEV_ID
                        Developer ID

package subcommands:
  package, sign and release external

                        additional help
    collect_dmg         collect dmg
    dist                create project distribution folder
    dmg                 package distribution folder as .dmg
    notarize_dmg        notarize dmg
    sign                sign all required folders recursively
    sign_dmg            sign dmg
    staple_dmg          staple dmg


```

### The Project's `Makefile` frontend:

Since the Makefile frontend basically just calles on `builder` interface in a simplified way, we will use it to explain the basic steps which occur sequentially. Note that while it is possible to automate thie process considerable, it is separated here into discrete steps for purposes of illustration and to facilitate debugging:

1. Recursively sign all externals in the `external folder` and/or binaries in the `support` folder

    ```bash
    make sign
    ```

2. Gather all project resources into a distribution folder and then convert it into a `.dmg`

    ```bash
    make dmg
    ```

3. Sign the DMG

    ```bash
    make sign-dmg
    ```

4. Notarize the DMG (send it to Apple for validation and notarization)

```bash
make notarize-dmg
```

5. Staple a valid notarization ticket to the DMG

```bash
make staple-dmg
```

6. Zip the DMG and collect into in the `$HOME/Downloads/PY-JS` folder

```bash
make collect-dmg
```

Note that the it is important to sign externals (this is done by Xcode automatically) and to distribute to others, you can either ask users to remove the products quarantine state or notarize the product as above, which requires an Apple Developer License.


### Github Actions

There are a number of Github actions in the project which basically automate the packaging, signing and notarization steps described above.

The only caveat is that currently Github only provide `x86_64` runners so one has to build for `arm64` on a dedicated machine.
