title: "mpyx: a single-header c++ python3 library for min-api max externals"
---

This is a proof-of-concept external using a variant of the `py_interpreter.h` single-header c++ python3 library from the `cobra` project, called `mpy_interpreter.h`, which is compatible for use with [min-api](https://github.com/cycling74/min-api)-based projects.

## Usage

This can be built individually with:

```sh
make mpyx
```

For a relocatable dynamically-linked build

```sh
make mpyx-shared
```

For a relocatable statically-linked build

```sh
make mpyx-static
```
