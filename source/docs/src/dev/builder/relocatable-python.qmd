# Relocatable Python

Some basic links to capture research threads so far on relocatable python:

## py2app

py2app seems like the most promising solution but i haven't seen any embedded python examples so far which fit the max/msp model.

Although it definitely look like it deal with the common use cases, I'm not sure it can deal with our particular requirements.

see: https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/py2app/issues/303

## Python Bug Report asking for greater support for relocatable python

- https://bugs.python.org/issue18309
- https://bugs.python.org/issue42514

Also python-packaging discussion forums:

## Repurposing Homebrew Python

This blog post by Joao Ventura, made this project possible since it provided a method to re=use the well-package homebrew python easily.

## Building Static Python

Best methods so far by [Beeware](https://github.com/beeware)

Specifically:

- https://github.com/beeware/Python-Apple-support
- https://github.com/beeware/briefcase

I've learned a whole lot from their Python-Apple-support project which has been a incredibly useful for self-contained static externals.

## Homebrew Python

This ruby script builds Python for Homebrew packaging. Incredibly interesting and overwhelming.

## Making Python (Frameworks) relocatable

[Greg Neagle](https://github.com/gregneagle) is focused on the the specific case of making python relocatable and has a great github project to accomplish this in a straightforward way. It only works for Python.frameworks I think right now..

Another related github project by Infinidata also seems to target the same as well. Must investigate further.

- https://github.com/Infinidat/relocatable-python3

It uses zc.buildout, installs modules without asking permission,
loads custom dependencies from a commercial website.. Not my cup of tea.
