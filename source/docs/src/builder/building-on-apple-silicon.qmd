# Building py-js externals on Apple Silicon


## Dev Notes

- current main branch works after shift to `max-base-sdk`
- build variation tested successfully so far: `framework-ext`

## What I did

- used `framework-ext`

- Changed `configure` of `FrameworkPythonBuilder` to include
 `--with-universal-archs=universal2` but did **NOT**  include `--enable-universalsdk`

- The `Python.framework` was consequently built as a native framework

- After trying to run in xcode, there were some linking errors.

- Had to change the `py-js.xcconfig` of `framework-ext` or the configuration in XCODE such that 

```text
// added $(PYJS_BUILD_LIB) to FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATH
// Did this directly via xcode but you can 
// add it to `py-js.xcconfig`

FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATH = $(inherited) $(PYJS_BUILD_LIB)
```

- Changed the target architecture to `arm64`
